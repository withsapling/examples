# Sapling with React Component

This is a Sapling site with a React component. You obviously should **not** reach for React for something as simple as a counter. However, this is a proof of concept that you could include a complex React component in Sapling. You could also mix this with a [sapling-island](https://sapling.land/docs/sapling-island) component to defer the React script until the component is needed.

The same setup would work for just about any other heavier client side library such as Vue, Svelte, etc using Vite as the bundler and binding to a root element.

## Getting Started

```bash
deno task dev
```
