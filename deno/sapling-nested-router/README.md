# Sapling Basics Template With a Nested Router

This is the same as the [Basics Template](../basics/README.md), but with a nested router at `./routes/router.ts`.

You might end up finding this pattern useful if you want to have a more complex routing system and don't want to fill up your `index.ts` file with all your routes.

## Usage

```sh
deno task start
```
