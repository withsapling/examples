# Supabase Edge

You can deploy the code located at `supabase/functions/hello-world` as a
Supabase Edge Function. This is effectively the same code as the
[Deno Deploy example](../deno-deploy) since Supabase Edge Functions are Deno
functions.

## Usage

Follow the
[Supabase Edge Function docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions) to run
the code locally and deploy the function.
